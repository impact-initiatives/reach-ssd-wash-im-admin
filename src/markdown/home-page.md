## 1. Background and Rationale

The dynamic and multi-faceted nature of the South Sudanese displacement crisis has created significant challenges for the delivery of humanitarian aid. Accessibility and security issues within South Sudan have impeded systematic understanding of WASH needs in many areas of the country, and have created difficulties in establishing a clear and unambiguous system for prioritizing the delivery of aid, thereby limiting the effectiveness of humanitarian planning and limiting the potential impact of donor funding. As this crisis continues to expand, evolve and spill into neighbouring countries, it has become increasingly important to fill information gaps that open as a result in a systematic and comprehensive manner to inform more effective humanitarian response and planning for immediate life-saving WASH activities and contingency planning for durable solutions.

In September 2015, the South Sudan WASH Cluster, along with the humanitarian community across the country, undertook the Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) process in order to identify the overall needs and vulnerabilities of the crisis-affected population. It brought to light significant WASH-specific information gaps across South Sudan. In particular, various baseline assessments conducted by WASH actors produced incomparable data that could not be analyzed together. The lack of inter-operable data made it challenging, both to quantify needs and to accurately rank the severity of the WASH situation in the different administrative areas.

## 2. General Objectives

To support evidence-based WASH partner interventions in South Sudan through the provision of actionable information gathered from a common baseline methodology, tools, analysis and reporting framework. This actionable information will be used to identify priority areas and / or populations and the key WASH concerns within, rank the comparative needs across the country to improve priority targeting, and will also actionable information to help shape what kind type of intervention should be implemented.

## 3. Specific Objectives

1.	To support the WASH Cluster so that it can gather, consolidate and produce actionable information from WASH data collected in South Sudan.
2.	Drawing on best information management practices through connectivity and absorbing lessons learned during other WASH-related assessments and assessments conducted by other clusters.
3.	To strengthen a common analysis of assessments conducted by WASH, Health and Nutrition clusters.
4.	To provide capacity building to humanitarian and development WASH actors working in both rural and urban settings.
5.	To strengthen the close collaborative work with the relevant local and global actors to ensure that the work achieved throughout the project has the continued support of these partners and that the tools developed and trainings held are applicable to the current context and WASH partner needs. 
6.	Creating outputs that can be handed over to the South Sudan WASH Cluster following the completion of the project, so that partners can continue to utilize the data collection tools and continue to access data through the WASH Knowledge Management and Decision Support Web Platform.
